# ALTAIR Software developer test 

Carefully read acceptance criteria and for any clarification you might need,
feel free to mail [mgalvez@altair.com](mgalvez@altair.com) for more info.

As a rule of thumb, tests should cover the most part of functionality.

__ArraySorter__

This class has to be able to sort an array of figures in package 'polygons' (already implemented)
according to its area.
Please follow the criteria below:

	-	Sorting can be ascending or descending.
	-	After sorting, please use 'print(Element[] )' to show the name of each element in the right order.
	-	Feel free to create any class or interface you might find appropriate. 
	-	Before you ask, we won't be creating objects with the same area :)
